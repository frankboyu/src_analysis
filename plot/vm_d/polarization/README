To run open up a ROOT terminal 
> root -l

Load the makePolVals2021.C file:

root [0] .L makePolVals2021.C

root [1] makePolVals2021(0)

There is one argument:                0 -> Standard run set
                                      1 -> User defined run set

When using the user defined run set, place the list of runs
(one run per row) in the file ./inFiles/userSet.txt
